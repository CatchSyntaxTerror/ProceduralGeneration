# Procedural Generation

Welcome to my **procedural animation** sandbox! This project is an early experiment in bringing entities to life without hand-crafted frames. Here, a **snake-like being** slithers through space, guided by math.

## What is Procedural Animation?

Procedural animation is motion **generated on the fly** through code. Unlike traditional animation, there are no pre-recorded frames. Instead, the motion emerges from rules, math, and input.

- Real-time character movement
- Fluid simulations
- A snake with no animation sprites—just segments obeying constraints

## Features Implemented So Far

| File | Role                                                                       |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Main.java`         | Initializes the simulation, sets up the frame and loop                     |
| `Entity.java`       | Base class with position, velocity, and angle logic                        |
| `Snake.java`        | The star of the show: controls segment-chain logic for procedural movement |
| `Segment.java`      | Represents a body part of the snake; follows the segment ahead of it       |
| `KeyHandler.java`   | Handles keyboard input (WASD / arrows) to steer the snake                  |
| `MouseHandler.java` | Handles mouse following                                                    |

## Behavior and Motion

The snake moves with a **procedural wiggle**—each `Segment` smoothly follows the one before it. As you steer with the keyboard, the head pulls the body along, and the chain reacts in real-time.

This technique mimics simple **kinematics** to give the illusion of soft-bodied motion using only angles and distances—no physics engine, no bones, just code.

## Future Features

- Smoother, smarter turning
- More animals
- Debug UI for visualizing constraints and deltas
